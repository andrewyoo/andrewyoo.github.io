<h1>
  Soda Is Going To Be Illegal For Kids
</h1>

<p>
  I just read a article in the SF Gate announcing it will be 
  <a href='http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/In-this-city-offering-a-kid-a-soda-is-about-to-6294957.php'>illegal for a restaurant to offer a child soda as a drink option</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Soda is NOT healthy and it probably does have a contribution to childhood obesity, but do we really want to pass laws on such things?  This reminds me of the movie V for Vendetta which warns that people are giving up their rights from fear for safety.

<blockquote>
  "And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance, coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those who are more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable. But again, truth be told...if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
  <br />
  <br />
  I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War. Terror. Disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense."
</blockquote>

  Now I don't condone giving children soda or drugs, but there are things that should be left to parents and society without laws.  This is a slippery slope of giving up rights.  What's next? Meat, candy, cookies, music, video games?  The thing is almost everything is bad for you if you eat or do enough of it.  Everything has to be done in moderation and that is a rule of life and doesn't need to be written in law.

50 years from now people might look back at us and call us monsters for eating steaks, owning pets, not using bidets, driving cars on gasoline.  My point is something are wrong and some things should be up to society to train their generation of such things, but we shouldn't give up our rights to try to save everyone, or we might lose everyone.  Isn't this the land of the free?
