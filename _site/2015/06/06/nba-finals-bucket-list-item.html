  NBA Finals Game 1
</h1>
<p>
  Thanks FlywheelNetworks for sending me to the NBA Finals game 1.  I have never been to a finals game before, and this game was for the ages!
</p>
<h3>
  Look at what this game had:
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Down 15 points in the 1st quarter</li>
  <li>Basically tied by half time and close pretty much all game</li>
  <li>Lebron James and he scored 40 something points</li>
  <li>Game winner opportunity by Lebron but good thing he missed!</li>
  <li>OVERTIME!!!</li>
  <li>And of course the <span style='color:green'>WIN!</span></li>
</ul>
